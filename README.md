### E-XAI: Evaluating Black-Box Explainable AI Frameworks for Network Intrusion Detection

### Abstract
The escalating frequency of intrusions on networked systems has spurred a wave of innovative research in artificial intelligence (AI) techniques tailored for intrusion detection systems (IDS). The burgeoning need for comprehensible and interpretable AI models is evident among security analysts tasked with overseeing these IDS to ensure the integrity of their networks. Addressing this need, we introduce an all-encompassing framework designed to rigorously evaluate black-box XAI methods applied to network IDS.

Our study encapsulates an examination of both global and local scopes of these enigmatic XAI methods in the realm of network intrusion detection. We meticulously analyze six diverse evaluation metrics, specifically tailored for two renowned black-box XAI techniques, SHAP and LIME. These evaluation metrics are artfully woven, encapsulating essential elements from both network security and AI paradigms.

The robustness and versatility of our XAI evaluation framework is validated through extensive trials involving three prominent network intrusion datasets and seven distinct AI methods, each exuding unique attributes. We wholeheartedly extend an invitation to the network security community, offering unrestricted access to our codes, aspiring to establish a foundational XAI framework for network IDS.

Our empirical findings unveil the intrinsic limitations and unparalleled strengths inherent in contemporary black-box XAI methods when meticulously applied to network IDS, offering invaluable insights and serving as a catalyst for future exploratory endeavors in this domain.
